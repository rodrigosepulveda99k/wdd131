            <p>Mendoza is a city in western Argentina and capital of the province of the same name. It is located in the
                plain east of the Andes mountain range. It is one of the main cities in the country, and with its urban
                agglomerate, called Greater Mendoza, it reaches a total population that exceeds one million inhabitants.
                Its surface is 57 km², although its metropolitan area extends 168 km².

                It is a main industrial hub, a fundamental strategic point in Mercosur relations. Economic activity is
                linked to commerce, the service industry and mainly tourist activity around the wine industry, which is
                why, along with other cities in the world, it is called the world capital of wine.</p>
